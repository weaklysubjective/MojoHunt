A TREASURE HUNT ON THE CHIA BLOCKCHAIN 

What is better than a vanilla treasure hunt ? A treasure hunt, for rewards, buried in the vast universe of stars and galaxies , enforced by Smart Contracts on the Chia decentralized blockchain. Even better,is a Virtual Reality 3D immersive experience with all the above features. Welcome to MojoHunter!

The randomness, and the infinite number of celestial objects,and the failsafe enforcement of payment of the promised reward,  makes it for an engaging gaming experience.

MojoHunter's scene opens up to a Planetarium-like setting where the stars and galaxies are plotted as accurately as possible in a galactic coordinate system with the galactic plane dissecting the two hemispheres.

At a basic level it serves as an educational app, one in which players wear an Oculus Headset, point their controllers at the various objects and learn their names, and orientation. At an advanced level, one can be a sponsor of a treasure hunt, or play to win many such contracts that will exist on the blockchain

If you have a spendable Chia Wallet, you can sponsor treasure hunts for the public to play. Solve challenges provided as clues by visiting stars and galaxies, to win the reward that will be paid out by a Chia SmartContract. There are no middlemen, no way to renege on the promise. The blockchain will enforce the contract and reward the FIRST person to play and win any given game. 

In a well adopted, and balanced app, with a good number of daily active users, it is expected that there will be a balance between sponsors and hunters.

MojoHunt is more than a proof of concept of Chia blockchain, it is proof Chia is a viable blockchain for many metaverse multi-user gaming ideas.
