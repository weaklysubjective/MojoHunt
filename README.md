A TREASURE HUNT ON THE CHIA BLOCKCHAIN 

What is better than a treasure hunt ? A treasure hunt for rewards buried in the vast universe of stars and galaxies , enforced by Smart Contracts on the Chia decentralized blockchain ? Whatâ€™s even better ? The aforementioned as a Virtual Reality for a 3D immersive game.

In a nutshell, this is what MojoHunter offers. The randomness, the variability of the celestial objects and the failsafe enforcement of payment of the promised reward is a must have gaming experience.

When the scene opens up, it will display a Planetarium-like setting where the stars and galaxies are plotted as accurately as possible in a galactic coordinate system with the galactic plane dissecting the two hemispheres.

At a basic level it serves as an educational app, one in which players could wear an Oculus Headset, point your Controller at the various objects and infer their names, and find out what constellations have what stars in them. At an advanced level, you can be a sponsor of a treasure hunt, or play to win many such contracts that exist on the blockchain

If you have created a spendable Chia Wallet, you can sponsor treasure hunts for the public to play. The challenge would be to visit the provided star names, in the order they were visited by the sponsor, to win the reward , which will be paid out by a Chia SmartContract. There are no middlemen, no way to renege on the promise. The blockchain will enforce the contract and reward the FIRST person to play and win any given game. The challenge is not so much solving the clues, rather to play it fast to beat out the rest.

In a well adopted, and balanced app, with a good number of daily active users, it is expected that there will be a balance between sponsors and hunters.

MojoHunt is more than a proof of concept of Chia blockchain, it is Exhibit-A of Chia as a viable blockchain for many metaverse multi-user gaming ideas.
